### Task: Initialize Rust workspace with Cargo.toml and workspace members (core, ui, render, cache, scheduler)

**Status:** Complete

**Changes:**
- Created root Cargo.toml with workspace configuration
- Created 5 workspace member crates in `crates/` directory:
  - `pdf-editor-core`: Document core and state model
  - `pdf-editor-ui`: UI/viewport compositor with GPU-rendered retained scene graph
  - `pdf-editor-render`: PDF render pipeline with tile-based rendering
  - `pdf-editor-cache`: Tile cache system with RAM, VRAM, and disk storage
  - `pdf-editor-scheduler`: Job scheduler with priority queue and cancellable workers
- Each crate includes proper Cargo.toml with workspace inheritance
- Each crate includes lib.rs with module-level documentation
- All crates compile successfully with `cargo check`
- Linting passes with `cargo clippy` (no warnings)

**Files Created:**
- Cargo.toml (workspace root)
- crates/core/Cargo.toml, crates/core/src/lib.rs
- crates/ui/Cargo.toml, crates/ui/src/lib.rs
- crates/render/Cargo.toml, crates/render/src/lib.rs
- crates/cache/Cargo.toml, crates/cache/src/lib.rs
- crates/scheduler/Cargo.toml, crates/scheduler/src/lib.rs
