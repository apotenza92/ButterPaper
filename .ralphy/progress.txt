- PRD.md (marked multiple tasks as complete: tile rendering, tile identity, preview profile, crisp profile)

**Architecture Notes:**
- Tile size is fixed at 256x256 pixels (configurable via TileRenderer::with_tile_size())
- TileId provides unique identity for caching: page index, coordinate, zoom, rotation, profile
- TileProfile::Preview uses faster rendering without form data
- TileProfile::Crisp uses high-quality rendering with print quality and form data
- Tile rendering extracts regions from full-page renders (optimization for Phase 3: render only visible tiles)
- Edge tiles are automatically sized to fit page boundaries (may be smaller than 256x256)
- Zoom levels represented as percentage (100 = 100%, 200 = 200%, etc.)
- Rotation support prepared (0, 90, 180, 270 degrees) but not yet implemented in rendering
- TileId implements Hash for efficient cache key generation
- RenderedTile includes utility methods: byte_size() and is_opaque()

**Technical Details:**
- Default tile size: 256x256 pixels (TILE_SIZE constant)
- Pixel format: RGBA (4 bytes per pixel)
- Zoom calculation: zoomed_dimension = page_dimension * (zoom_level / 100.0)
- Tile grid calculation uses div_ceil() for accurate tile count
- Preview profile: render_form_data(false), no print quality
- Crisp profile: render_form_data(true), use_print_quality(true)
- Full page rendering then tile extraction (will optimize in Phase 4 with viewport-aware rendering)
- Edge handling: fills with white (255, 255, 255, 255) if needed
- Comprehensive test coverage: coordinates, cache keys, grid calculation, profiles, tile metadata

**Integration Points:**
- Ready for Phase 3 caching system (TileId provides cache keys)
- Ready for Phase 4 job scheduler (tile rendering is independent, parallelizable)
- Ready for Phase 6 viewport compositor (RenderedTile provides GPU-ready pixel data)
- Prepared for future optimizations: viewport-based rendering, progressive loading

**Files Modified:**
- crates/render/src/lib.rs (added progressive module export)
- PRD.md (marked task as complete)

**Architecture Notes:**
- Two-stage loading strategy: preview tiles rendered first, then crisp tiles replace them

- Crisp stage uses TileProfile::Crisp (high-quality rendering with print quality)
- State tracking enables cache integration and prevents duplicate rendering
- ProgressCallback allows UI updates as tiles load (e.g., for progress bars or visual feedback)
- Thread-safe state tracking via Arc<Mutex<HashMap>> for concurrent access
- Callback invoked for each stage completion with tile ID, state, and rendered data
- load_tile() loads a single tile in two stages, returning both preview and crisp
- load_page_tiles() loads entire page: all previews first, then all crisp tiles
- State management separated from rendering logic for clean architecture

**Technical Details:**
- TileState enum: NotLoaded, PreviewLoaded, CrispLoaded
- ProgressCallback: Arc<dyn Fn(TileId, TileState, &RenderedTile) + Send + Sync>
- State tracking uses TileId as key (includes profile distinction)
- get_tile_state() returns NotLoaded for untracked tiles (safe default)
- clear_states() useful for document switching or memory management
- tracked_tile_count() provides visibility into loader memory usage
- Comprehensive test coverage: state tracking, clearing, callback structure, loader creation
- Preview-first strategy provides immediate visual feedback (critical for UX)
- Crisp tiles upgrade preview tiles for final high-quality display

**Integration Points:**
- Ready for Phase 3 caching system (state tracking prevents re-rendering cached tiles)
- Ready for Phase 4 job scheduler (progressive loading fits priority-based scheduling)
- Ready for Phase 5 document loading (fast first-page preview → crisp upgrade)
- Ready for Phase 6 viewport (callback enables real-time tile display updates)
- Callback system designed for GPU texture upload notifications
- State management enables intelligent prefetching decisions

**User Experience Benefits:**
- Immediate visual feedback: preview tiles load first (fast)
- Progressive refinement: crisp tiles upgrade quality without blocking UI
- Perceived performance: user sees content quickly, quality improves automatically
- Perfect for large documents: prioritize visible content, upgrade quality progressively

**Status:** Complete

**Changes:**

**Files Created:**

**Files Modified:**
- crates/cache/src/lib.rs (added ram module and exports)
- PRD.md (marked task as complete)

**Architecture Notes:**
- Thread-safe design using Arc<Mutex> for multi-threaded access
- LRU eviction uses VecDeque: front = least recently used, back = most recently used
- Cache key is u64 hash (compatible with TileId::cache_key() from render crate)
- Memory tracking at byte level for precise budget management
- Automatic eviction ensures memory limit is never exceeded
- get() updates LRU order (marks tile as recently used)
- contains() checks presence without affecting LRU order (useful for preflight checks)
- Statistics enable performance monitoring and debugging
- CachedTile cloning is efficient for retrieval (pixels are Vec<u8>)

**Technical Details:**
- Default memory limit: 256MB (configurable via constructor or with_mb_limit())
- CacheKey type: u64 (hash from TileId)
- Memory tracking includes only pixel data (Vec<u8> heap allocation)
- LRU eviction: O(n) worst case for queue manipulation, but fast in practice
- Touch operation removes and re-adds key to back of queue (marks as most recent)
- Eviction continues until sufficient space is available for new tile
- put() with existing key updates the tile (replaces old data)
- Statistics track: tile_count, memory_used, hits, misses, evictions
- Helper methods: hit_rate() and memory_utilization() for easy monitoring
- set_memory_limit() dynamically adjusts limit and evicts if needed

**API Summary:**
- `new(memory_limit)` - Create cache with byte limit
- `with_mb_limit(megabytes)` - Create cache with MB limit
- `put(key, pixels, width, height)` - Store tile (auto-evicts if needed)
- `get(key)` - Retrieve tile (updates LRU, tracks hit/miss)
- `contains(key)` - Check presence (no LRU update)
- `remove(key)` - Explicitly remove tile
- `clear()` - Remove all tiles
- `stats()` - Get cache statistics
- `set_memory_limit(bytes)` - Update memory limit
- `memory_limit()`, `memory_used()`, `tile_count()` - Query current state

**Test Coverage:**
1. test_basic_put_get - Basic storage and retrieval
2. test_cache_miss - Miss tracking and statistics
3. test_lru_eviction - Automatic eviction when limit exceeded
4. test_lru_ordering - LRU ordering based on access patterns
5. test_contains - Presence checking without LRU update
6. test_remove - Explicit tile removal
7. test_clear - Clear all tiles
8. test_stats - Statistics tracking (hits, misses, rates)
9. test_memory_tracking - Accurate memory usage tracking
10. test_set_memory_limit - Dynamic limit adjustment with eviction
11. test_update_existing_tile - Updating existing cache entries
12. test_default_cache - Default 256MB limit
13. test_with_mb_limit - MB-based constructor

**Integration Points:**
- Ready for Phase 3: GPU texture cache (similar LRU strategy for VRAM)
- Ready for Phase 3: Disk cache (can use RAM cache as L1, disk as L2)
- Ready for Phase 4: Job scheduler (check cache before scheduling render jobs)
- Ready for Phase 5: Document loading (cache enables fast reopening)
- Ready for Phase 6: Viewport compositor (retrieve tiles from cache for display)
- CacheKey compatible with TileId::cache_key() from render crate
- Thread-safe design enables concurrent access from render workers

**Performance Characteristics:**
- put(): O(n) worst case for eviction, O(1) average for insertion
- get(): O(n) for LRU update (VecDeque retain), but fast for small caches
- contains(): O(1) HashMap lookup
- remove(): O(n) for LRU queue update
- clear(): O(1) with deallocation
- Memory overhead: ~24 bytes per entry (HashMap + VecDeque nodes)

**Future Optimizations:**
- Could use a doubly-linked list for O(1) LRU updates (more complex implementation)
- Could implement approximate LRU with lower overhead (trade accuracy for speed)
- Could add cache warming strategies (preload commonly used tiles)
- Could implement multi-level caching (RAM → VRAM → Disk)
