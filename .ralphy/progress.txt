### Task: Initialize Rust workspace with Cargo.toml and workspace members (core, ui, render, cache, scheduler)

**Status:** Complete

**Changes:**
- Created root Cargo.toml with workspace configuration
- Created 5 workspace member crates in `crates/` directory:
  - `pdf-editor-core`: Document core and state model
  - `pdf-editor-ui`: UI/viewport compositor with GPU-rendered retained scene graph
  - `pdf-editor-render`: PDF render pipeline with tile-based rendering
  - `pdf-editor-cache`: Tile cache system with RAM, VRAM, and disk storage
  - `pdf-editor-scheduler`: Job scheduler with priority queue and cancellable workers
- Each crate includes proper Cargo.toml with workspace inheritance
- Each crate includes lib.rs with module-level documentation
- All crates compile successfully with `cargo check`
- Linting passes with `cargo clippy` (no warnings)

**Files Created:**
- Cargo.toml (workspace root)
- crates/core/Cargo.toml, crates/core/src/lib.rs
- crates/ui/Cargo.toml, crates/ui/src/lib.rs
- crates/render/Cargo.toml, crates/render/src/lib.rs
- crates/cache/Cargo.toml, crates/cache/src/lib.rs
- crates/scheduler/Cargo.toml, crates/scheduler/src/lib.rs

### Task: Set up GPU abstraction layer with Metal backend for macOS

**Status:** Complete

**Changes:**
- Created GPU abstraction layer in `pdf-editor-ui` crate with platform-agnostic traits
- Implemented Metal backend for macOS with full GPU context support
- Added core GPU abstractions: GpuContext, Texture, and Buffer traits
- Implemented MetalContext with device and command queue initialization
- Created MetalTexture with support for multiple pixel formats (RGBA/BGRA, sRGB/linear)
- Created MetalBuffer with managed storage mode and data upload capabilities
- Added proper error handling with GpuError enum
- Added platform-specific dependencies: metal, cocoa, core-graphics-types, objc
- All code compiles successfully with `cargo check`
- Linting passes with `cargo clippy` (no warnings)

**Files Created:**
- crates/ui/src/gpu/mod.rs (GPU abstraction layer)
- crates/ui/src/gpu/metal.rs (Metal backend implementation)

**Files Modified:**
- crates/ui/Cargo.toml (added Metal dependencies for macOS)
- crates/ui/src/lib.rs (added gpu module)

**Architecture Notes:**
- GPU abstraction designed to support future DirectX (Windows) and Vulkan (Linux) backends
- Metal backend uses managed storage mode for textures and buffers
- Texture formats support both sRGB and linear color spaces
- Buffer usage flags prepared for vertex, index, and uniform buffers
- Frame begin/end hooks ready for rendering pipeline integration

### Task: Create basic application window with GPU-rendered UI shell using metal-rs

**Status:** Complete

**Changes:**
- Created new binary crate `pdf-editor` in `crates/app` as the main application entry point
- Implemented cross-platform windowing using winit 0.30
- Set up Metal rendering pipeline with MetalLayer for GPU-accelerated rendering
- Implemented basic event loop with ApplicationHandler trait
- Added window event handling (close, resize, redraw)
- Integrated with GPU abstraction layer from pdf-editor-ui crate
- Created simple render pass that clears the window with dark gray color
- Set up frame-by-frame rendering loop (game-style updates)
- All code compiles successfully with `cargo check`
- Linting passes with `cargo clippy` (5 deprecation warnings from cocoa crate are expected)

**Files Created:**
- crates/app/Cargo.toml (binary crate configuration)
- crates/app/src/main.rs (application entry point with windowing and rendering)

**Files Modified:**
- Cargo.toml (added app crate to workspace members)
- PRD.md (marked task as complete)

**Architecture Notes:**
- Application uses winit for cross-platform window management
- Metal layer is attached directly to the native window view on macOS
- Rendering uses event-driven model with continuous redraw requests
- Window size changes update Metal drawable size automatically
- GPU context initialization is separate from window creation for better modularity
- Current implementation renders a solid color, ready for scene graph integration

**Technical Details:**
- Window size: 1200x800 pixels (default)
- Metal pixel format: BGRA8Unorm_sRGB
- Clear color: RGB(0.2, 0.2, 0.2) dark gray
- Dependencies: winit 0.30, raw-window-handle 0.6, metal 0.29, cocoa 0.26, core-graphics-types 0.1

### Task: Implement retained scene graph for UI rendering

**Status:** Complete

**Changes:**
- Created comprehensive scene graph system in `pdf-editor-ui` crate
- Implemented SceneNode with hierarchical structure and dirty tracking
- Added Transform system for 2D transformations (translation, scale, rotation)
- Created Primitive enum for GPU-renderable shapes (Rectangle, TexturedQuad, Line, Circle)
- Implemented SceneGraph with automatic transform propagation
- Added RenderCommand system for flattening scene graph to GPU commands
- Created SceneRenderer to integrate scene graph with GPU backend
- Integrated scene graph into main application with sample primitives
- Added comprehensive unit tests for scene graph functionality
- All code compiles successfully with `cargo check`
- Linting passes with `cargo clippy` (no warnings)

**Files Created:**
- crates/ui/src/scene.rs (retained scene graph implementation)
- crates/ui/src/renderer.rs (scene graph GPU renderer)

**Files Modified:**
- crates/ui/src/lib.rs (added scene and renderer modules)
- crates/app/src/main.rs (integrated scene graph with sample primitives)
- PRD.md (marked task as complete)

**Architecture Notes:**
- Scene graph uses Arc<SceneNode> for efficient sharing and cloning
- Dirty tracking system minimizes unnecessary re-renders
- Transform system uses hierarchical composition (parent → child)
- Render commands flatten the scene graph into GPU-ready primitives with world transforms
- Visibility culling at node level (invisible nodes don't generate render commands)
- NodeId system provides unique identifiers for scene nodes
- Renderer abstraction allows scene graph to work with any GPU backend

**Technical Details:**
- SceneNode supports arbitrary hierarchy depth via Vec<Arc<SceneNode>>
- Transform uses simplified 2D transform (translation, scale, rotation)
- Color uses RGBA with f32 components (0.0 to 1.0 range)
- Primitives include: Rectangle, TexturedQuad, Line, Circle
- Scene graph traversal is depth-first, preserving render order
- Sample scene includes red rectangle (center), blue rectangle (top-left), green circle (right)
- Comprehensive test coverage: node IDs, transforms, dirty tracking, visibility
